<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## Project Contents
</br>
* Dataset Used
         1.1 Information about dataset				
         1.2 Where did we find it?
         1.3 Why did we choose it specifically?
</br>
* Analytical questions
         2.1 What’s the percentage of boys to girls & who are successful among them?
         2.2 How many absentees are there in each subject for each specialty?
         2.3 What’s the percentage of different specializations & who’re the successful/fail ones?
         2.4 Percentage of successful students in each governorate
         2.5 The overall success rate of students in each subject
         2.6 Who are the top ten students in each specialty?
         2.7 Which administration and school has the highest average grades in Alexandria?
         2.8 Did the majority pass the exams with a half grade in each subject?         2.9  Possible cheating rates in exams for each city
</br>
* Application of Mining Techniques
        3.1 The subject that most affects status by Classification Algorithm ( Decision Tree )
        3.2 Possible grades that were added to the failing student to pass the exam ) K-Medoids )
        3.3 Classifying students’ level in each subject using advanced clustering ( Fuzzy )
        3.4 The relationship between each subject and grouping similar ones ( Hierarchical )
</br>

### Features:
- Working on data approved by the Ministry of Education consists of 153,833 rows and 25 columns
- An analysis that includes performance in each subject separately
- It also includes an expectation of cheating during exams and a detailed graph for each specialty showing the most conservative areas in the country in which cheating occurs.

### Built With

* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) - For interactive computing and creating notebooks.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - For data analysis and scripting.
